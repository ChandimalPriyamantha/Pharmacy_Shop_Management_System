1. Detailed Problem Description

We propose to design and build a thorough pharmacy shop management application that will streamline business processes and ensure effective staff management, customer engagement, medication inventory control, precise financial tracking, formal communication facilities (email), remote medication distribution, and strong reporting capabilities. The app will target both small and large pharmacies and be user-friendly and accessible.


Problem Proposition:

Due to manual processes, many small- and medium-sized pharmacies find it difficult to operate their business effectively, which causes mistakes in the management of inventory, customers, and finances.

Inefficiencies and significant revenue losses result from the lack of a centralised system for managing the inventory of medicines, customer information, and employee data.



2. Goals and Objectives: The project's goal is to provide a user-friendly, effective Pharmacy Shop Management Application that improves the workflow of pharmacy operations as a whole. The precise goals consist of:

1. Managing personnel Information: Create a module that makes it simple to handle personnel details such identities, responsibilities, and schedules.

2. Managing Customers: Create a customer management module that simplifies order history, communication, and customer registration.

3. Managing Medicine: Develop a module to check stock levels, expiration dates, and enable reordering alerts for medicines.

4. Managing Financials: Create a module for accounting and invoicing so that revenues, expenses, and client bills can all be tracked accurately.

5. Reporting: Create a reporting module that offers details on sales patterns, inventory turnover, profit margins, and other important performance metrics.

6. Formal Communication: Create a module that enables communication with clients and vendors.

7. Remote pharmaceutical Distribution: Create a pharmaceutical distribution module that offers consumers precise and efficient service.
